## Callum's Emacs config

Adapted from Bozhidar's personal config. Some things may not work properly for you.

### System dependencies
- Aspell for Flyspell
- `scss` and `scss_lint` gems for `scss-mode`

### Notes
- You may have to run the init file at least twice to get all the packages loading happily
