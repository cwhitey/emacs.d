## Callum's Emacs config

WIP Adapted from Bozhidar's personal config. Some things may not work properly for you.

### System dependencies
- Aspell for Flyspell
- `scss` and `scss_lint` gems for `scss-mode`

### Notes
- You may have to run the init file at least twice to get all the packages loading happily

### TODO
- Use `Cask`? Seems more reliable than getting use-package to pull packages based on package names. I've had problems with configuring existing major modes through use-package (e.g. `emacs-lisp-mode`) and this might help? Good emacs.d reference: `https://github.com/rejeep/emacs`
